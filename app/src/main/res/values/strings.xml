    <string name="app_help">What is Push It?</string>
    <string name="what_is_push_it" >Push it is a mobile app which allows you to create your own news-like page and produce content that could be shared with your friends and followers.\n\nEach user in the app is either a Content Creator or a Content Follower. As a Follower, you can follow other people\'s pages and get push notifications for every new update they publish. As a Creator you can create your own page and post articles. You can modify your user status at any time at the settings screen.\n\nBeing a Content Creator, you can modify your page at the page settings screen. You can change your page name and description, choose your page layout, upload your page logo and set your page as private.\n\nWhile public pages can be seen by everyone, including guest users, private pages can only be seen by followers which have been approved by the page owner.\n\nFollowing a page means that every time the page owner publishes an article, you will get a customized push notification straight to your mobile device.\n\nAs a page owner, you can remove followers and prevent them from seeing your notifications by long-pressing a user entry at the \'Page Followers\' screen, available under the page settings screen.\n\nWhen creating a new article, you can select one of 3 available modes:\n\n- Draft, meaning that the article will be invisible to other users while you\'re drafting and writing its content.\n- Posted, meaning that every user with access to your page will be able to see and read the content.\n- Published, meaning that a custom push notification was sent to your followers.\n\nWe hope you have a great time using Push It!\n\n- Team Push It</string>
